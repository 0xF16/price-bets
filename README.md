# Basic Bets

This project demonstrates how basic bets can be made in Solidity. It is built just to proof it is possible.

# How it works?

Someone deploys the contract and then different users place bets. In the constructor there are a parameters that define:

- oracle from which the price is being fetched
- when bidding should not longer be accepted
- after what time the final result should be validated and when rewards can be paid out

# To Do

- [ ] simplify smart-contract code
- [x] make all the necessary tests
- [ ] accept different collateral types
